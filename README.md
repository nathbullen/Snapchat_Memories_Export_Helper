# Snapchat Media Downloader with Metadata Preservation

A Python script to download Snapchat memories directly from your data export JSON file with full metadata preservation (dates, GPS coordinates, and EXIF data).

## Features

- 📥 Downloads all media from Snapchat JSON export files
- 📅 Preserves original creation dates
- 📍 Embeds GPS coordinates in EXIF metadata
- 🖼️ Sets EXIF data for images (date, location)
- ⏰ Updates file timestamps to match original dates
- 📁 Organizes files with date-based naming

## Prerequisites

### Python Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Required packages:
  ```bash
  pip install requests pillow piexif
  ```

### Getting Your Snapchat Data Export

1. Open Snapchat and go to your profile
2. Tap the ⚙️ (Settings) icon
3. Scroll down to **Privacy Controls**
4. Select **My Data**
5. Click **Submit Request**
6. Wait for Snapchat to email you (usually takes 24-48 hours)
7. Download the export ZIP file from the email link
8. Extract the ZIP file and locate the JSON file (usually in `json/memories_history.json` or similar)

## JSON Format

Your Snapchat export JSON file should contain a structure like this:

```json
{
    "Saved Media": [
        {
            "Date": "2024-05-06 23:18:11 UTC",
            "Media Type": "Image",
            "Location": "Latitude, Longitude: 40.7128, -74.0060",
            "Download Link": "https://app.snapchat.com/dmd/memories?uid=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx&sid=XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX&mid=XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX&ts=1234567890123&proxy=true&sig=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
            "Media Download Url": "https://us-east1-aws.api.snapchat.com/dmd/mm?uid=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx&sid=XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX&mid=XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX&ts=1234567890123&sig=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
        },
        {
            "Date": "2024-05-07 14:32:45 UTC",
            "Media Type": "Video",
            "Location": "Latitude, Longitude: 34.0522, -118.2437",
            "Download Link": "https://app.snapchat.com/dmd/memories?uid=...",
            "Media Download Url": "https://us-east1-aws.api.snapchat.com/dmd/mm?uid=..."
        }
    ]
}
```

### Required JSON Fields

- `Saved Media`: Array containing all media items
- `Date`: Creation date in format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC"
- `Media Type`: Either "Image" or "Video"
- `Location`: GPS coordinates in format "Latitude, Longitude: XX.XXXX, -XX.XXXX" (or "N/A")
- `Media Download Url`: Direct download URL for the media file

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install requests pillow piexif
   ```

## Usage

### Interactive Mode

Run the script and follow the prompts:

```bash
python download_via_json.py
```

You'll be asked to provide:
1. **JSON file path**: Path to your Snapchat export JSON file
2. **Output folder**: Where to save downloaded media (default: `downloads`)

### Example Session

```
=== Snapchat Media Downloader with Metadata Preservation ===

Enter JSON file path: memories_history.json
Enter output folder (or press Enter for 'downloads'): my_snapchat_memories

Loading JSON from: memories_history.json

## Output

### File Naming Convention

Files are named with the following pattern:
```
YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_<index>.<extension>
```

Examples:
- `20240506_231811_1.jpg` - Image taken on May 6, 2024 at 11:18:11 PM
- `20240507_143245_2.mp4` - Video taken on May 7, 2024 at 2:32:45 PM

### Metadata Preservation

#### For Images (.jpg, .jpeg)
- ✅ File modification/access timestamps
- ✅ EXIF creation date/time
- ✅ EXIF GPS coordinates (latitude/longitude)

#### For Videos (.mp4)
- ✅ File modification/access timestamps
- ⚠️ EXIF metadata (requires additional tools like ffmpeg)

## Troubleshooting

### Missing Dependencies

If you see this warning:
```
Warning: piexif not installed. Install with: pip install piexif pillow
```

Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install pillow piexif requests
```

### No Download URL Found

If items show "⚠ No download URL found, skipping", verify:
- Your JSON file has the `Media Download Url` field
- The JSON structure matches the expected format
- The export is complete and not corrupted

### EXIF Metadata Errors

If EXIF metadata fails to set:
- Ensure `piexif` and `pillow` are installed correctly
- Verify the image file is a valid JPEG/JPG
- Check you have write permissions in the output directory
- Some images may have incompatible formats

### Download Errors

If downloads fail:
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the download URLs haven't expired (Snapchat URLs are time-limited)
- Request a new data export if URLs are expired
- Ensure you have enough disk space

### Video Metadata

Video EXIF metadata embedding requires additional tools like `ffmpeg`. The script will attempt to use `ffmpeg` (if available in your system `PATH`) to write `creation_time` and certain location tags into MP4 files. If `ffmpeg` is not installed or not found, the script will skip embedding video metadata and only set file modification/access timestamps.

#### FFmpeg Requirement

- **What it's for:** `ffmpeg` is used to add `creation_time` and location metadata into MP4 containers so video files preserve original date and GPS information.
- **Behavior in the script:** If `ffmpeg` is missing, the script prints `Skipping video metadata (ffmpeg not found)` and continues — only file timestamps will be set. If `ffmpeg` is available, the script runs `ffmpeg` to copy streams and attach metadata.
- **Check installation:** Run `ffmpeg -version` in your shell to verify that `ffmpeg` is installed and available on your `PATH`.
- **Install `ffmpeg` (examples):**

  - Windows (Winget):

    ```
    winget install ffmpeg
    ```

  - Windows (Chocolatey):

    ```
    choco install ffmpeg -y
    ```

  - macOS (Homebrew):

    ```
    brew install ffmpeg
    ```

  - Debian/Ubuntu:

    ```
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y ffmpeg
    ```

- **Notes:**
  - Ensure the `ffmpeg` executable is on your `PATH` (open a new terminal after install if necessary).
  - After installing `ffmpeg`, re-run the script to enable video metadata embedding.

If you'd prefer not to install `ffmpeg`, the script still preserves timestamps and filenames but will not embed video EXIF/creation metadata.

## Tips & Best Practices

1. **Download Quickly**: The download URLs in Snapchat's export are time-limited. Download your memories as soon as you receive the export email.

2. **Keep Your JSON**: Save your JSON file as a backup - it contains all the metadata for your memories.

3. **Large Exports**: For large exports (100+ files), be patient. The script processes one file at a time to avoid overwhelming your connection.

4. **Organize by Date**: Files are automatically named with timestamps, making them easy to sort chronologically in any file browser.

5. **Check Output**: After downloading, verify a few files to ensure dates and locations are correctly embedded.

6. **Backup Originals**: Keep your original Snapchat export until you've verified all downloads are complete and correct.

## File Structure

After running the script, your output directory will look like:
```
downloads/
├── 20240101_120000_1.jpg
├── 20240102_153045_2.mp4
├── 20240103_091523_3.jpg
├── 20240104_180932_4.mp4
└── ...
```

## Common Use Cases

### Scenario 1: First Time Export
```bash
python download_via_json.py
# Enter: json/memories_history.json
# Enter: my_memories
```

### Scenario 2: Multiple Exports (Different People)
```bash
python download_via_json.py
# Enter: laura_memories.json
# Enter: laura_downloads

python download_via_json.py
# Enter: john_memories.json
# Enter: john_downloads
```

### Scenario 3: Organize by Year
```bash
python download_via_json.py
# Enter: memories_2024.json
# Enter: memories/2024
```

## Technical Details

### Date Parsing
- Input format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC`
- Output filename format: `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`
- EXIF format: `YYYY:MM:DD HH:MM:SS`

### GPS Coordinates
- Input format: `Latitude, Longitude: XX.XXXX, -XX.XXXX`
- Converted to EXIF DMS (Degrees, Minutes, Seconds) format
- Includes hemisphere indicators (N/S for latitude, E/W for longitude)

### File Extensions
- Images: `.jpg`
- Videos: `.mp4`
- Unknown: `.bin`

## Limitations

- Video EXIF metadata requires external tools (ffmpeg) for full support
- Download URLs from Snapchat expire after a certain period
- Large files may take time to download depending on your connection
- Some location data may be unavailable ("N/A") for certain memories
