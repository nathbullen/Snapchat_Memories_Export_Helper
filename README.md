### Step 2: Prepare Your Files
1. Locate the `index.html` file in the extracted export folder.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Use the interface to download all your memories into a single directory.

### Step 3: Process Your Files
1. Place all the downloaded memories into a single directory.
2. Run the `convert.ps1` script in PowerShell.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to process your exported Snapchat memories.

### What the Script Does
The `convert.ps1` script performs the following tasks:

1. **Folder Setup:**
   - Ensures the existence of the following folders within the specified root directory:
     - `original`: Stores the original files before processing.
     - `processed images`: Stores processed image files.
     - `unzipped`: Stores extracted contents of ZIP files.
     - `videos`: Stores video files.

2. **ZIP File Handling:**
   - Detects ZIP files and extracts their contents into the `unzipped` folder.

3. **Image Processing:**
   - Identifies files named `File` or files without extensions.
   - Checks if the file is a JPEG image by reading its signature.
   - Renames JPEG files with a `.jpeg` extension and moves them to the `processed images` folder.
   - Avoids overwriting by appending a numeric suffix to duplicate filenames.

4. **Video File Handling:**
   - Detects video files with extensions like `.mp4`, `.avi`, `.mov`, etc.
   - Moves video files to the `videos` folder.

5. **Dry Run Option:**
   - By default, the script performs a dry run, showing what actions it would take without making changes.
   - Set `$DryRun` to `$false` to enable actual processing.

## Requirements
- Windows operating system.
- PowerShell.
